### Hi, I'm Florian (he/him) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer, focusing on C++ and Python. I'm also in
no particular order a research software engineer, a cyclist, a physicist,
a scientific computing enthusiast, an amateur functional programmer,
a molecular dynamics expert and currently looking for a job which combines software
engineering with math, physics and technology.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently slowly but steadily working on a modern collection
of basic C++ numeric algorithm library called [nrng](https://github.com/fweik/nrng).

I'm a major contributor to the [Espresso](https://github.com/espressomd/espresso)
project, and was formerly a (paid) lead developer on the project.
I also sporadically contribute to other open source projects, mostly to scratch some
itches.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the 99 most important problems of scientific software development.
